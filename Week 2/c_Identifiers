Chapter 2 – Identifiers

- int main ()
.    main – identifier
.    int  – keyword
.    ( )  – used for a function call

Id::={letter ∣ underscore}
.     {letter ∣ underscore ∣ digit}

- Usable (correct) identifiers
.    K               -> one letter identifier (used for integers that are auxiliary integers 
.    _printf         -> that’s probably the identifier that the system programmers use when they design the printf function
.    two_words       -> the underbar is used to separate distinct words
.    twoWords        -> the capitalization beginning of the second word is also commonly used (DO NOT MIX THE TWO!)
.    my_dna23        -> once we are past the first digits we can use digits in the identifier as well 


- Unusable (incorrect) identifiers
.    #me       -> sharp (#) is not allowed anywhere
.    me#  

.    -x        -> x could be an identifier but -x is an expression
.
.    23my_dna  -> the first letter of that sequence is not allowed to be a digit



- Good choice of identifiers (id’s) should improve: document & readability

Standard library
.    main
.    printf
.    sqrt

“clearer image” identifiers
.    superman
.    radius

in mathematics community
.    i
.    j
.    k
.    n

- bad choices for identifiers

no concept of what they might be 
.    grx33   
.   _pp_25
makes sense, but mixed two conventions
.    I_am_fourWords


- “Unknown” ground – not sure if good or bad (all about context)
.    data
.    mxyzptlk     -> a typical foe of superman
.    x            -> good as a coordinate in the xy plane 
.    j
.    q            -> in the logic community, P and Q are typically chosen to mean Boolean variables
