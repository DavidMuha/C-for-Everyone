About this Course

In the new world we live in, coding is a universally valuable skill, whether you're a scientist, artist, or a humanist. 
Algorithms are everywhere, and we all have to understand how they work. 
The C language is particularly well suited as an introduction to coding: It's a tried-and-true language, and it allows you to understand computing processes at a deep level.
